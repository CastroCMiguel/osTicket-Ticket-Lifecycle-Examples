To create tickets within osTicket, users need to access the ticket portal and log in if required. In the portal, users can submit ticket requests and provide details about their IT-related issues. In this scenario, you've created three tickets, each describing different problems that could arise in a real environment. These tickets are generated using a Help Topic, a descriptive summary of the issue, and detailed information about the problem, all formatted as if they were emails or requests for assistance.

From the admin's perspective, they will receive ticket requests in their panel as soon as they are submitted. Admins have the authority to reassign tickets to specific agents or the relevant teams. They also assess the severity level of each issue and assign it accordingly to ensure that tickets are addressed within the appropriate Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this scenario, Jane, acting as an admin, viewed a ticket, reassigned it to the System Administrators, and adjusted the severity level to "Emergency" based on the nature and urgency of the problem.

Effective communication is crucial when resolving tickets. It involves maintaining clear and efficient communication within the team as well as with the affected users. Tickets vary in terms of issues and are assigned to different individuals based on their expertise. In this case, one ticket was assigned to John by Jane, while Jane was able to manage another ticket independently.

Documentation plays a vital role in maintaining a successful environment. Properly documenting tickets is essential because it allows for easy reference in the future, especially if a similar issue arises again. This documentation ensures that knowledge is retained within the organization and can be leveraged to resolve similar problems efficiently.


The protocols for ticket management can indeed vary based on the specific work environment and organizational needs. In some cases, there may be quotas or targets for the number of tickets that need to be resolved within a specified time frame. Additionally, certain tickets may need to be prioritized depending on their impact and urgency in a given situation.

This experience building osTicket from scratch has provided valuable insights into how tickets operate in an IT position. It's a practical way to grasp the nuances of ticketing systems and workflows, which can be applied effectively in real-world IT support roles.
